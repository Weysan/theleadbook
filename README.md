# theleadbook

> the one place for DevC leads to discover and connect

Not everyone takes notes, even fewer would share their interests and what they can offer on their social media profiles. Why not have a place just for that?

## Usage

### for developers

Create a PR on `assets/lead_profiles.yml` with your properly formatted entry

### for non-developers

Create an issue following the template **Add my lead profile**

## Install

To run a dev-server as you develop, clone this repo, `yarn`, and `yarn serve`

Before committing please make sure you `yarn lint`, we follow standard style here
